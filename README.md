I make software (mostly games) and audio-related stuff. Read more about the things I do at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amirreza-amouie/) or my [webpage](https://amuuu.github.io/about/).

Here are some of the repos that I haven't pinned but I like:

- [OS Notes](https://github.com/amuuu/os-notes) - Notes about operating systems collected from all over the internet and my brain.
- [Ava](https://github.com/amuuu/ava) - Open-source sound engine with C++ (archive)
